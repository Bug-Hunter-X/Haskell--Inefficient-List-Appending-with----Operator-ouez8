This code attempts to use the `++` operator to append an element to a list, but it does so inefficiently.  In Haskell, lists are linked lists, and the `++` operator has O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the first list. This means appending multiple elements to a list using `++` in a loop results in O(n^2) complexity.  This becomes extremely slow with larger lists.

```haskell
import Data.List (foldl')

buildList :: Int -> [Int]
buildList n = foldl' (++) [] [ [x] | x <- [1..n] ]
```
