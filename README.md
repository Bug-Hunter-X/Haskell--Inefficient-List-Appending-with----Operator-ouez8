This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in Haskell: inefficient list construction using repeated concatenation with the `++` operator. The `bug.hs` file contains code that exhibits this problem, while `bugSolution.hs` provides an optimized solution using `foldl'` for efficient list building. The problem is that `++` has O(n) complexity for a list of length n, so repeatedly appending elements leads to O(n^2) complexity.  The solution uses `foldl'` which performs the same operation with only O(n) complexity.
